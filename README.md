# Basic recipes in Python for UCDP API
This repository contains a set of basic Python scripts to access and process data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) API. The API allows you to interface directly with UCDP's systems to obtain, process, and subset UCDP data dynamically without the need to manually download data.

The main maintainer of the API is [Stina Högbladh](mailto:stina.hogbladh@pcr.uu.se). For questions about recipes and recipe requests, send an e-mail to [Mert Can Yılmaz](mailto:mertcan.yilmaz@pcr.uu.se).

## Why API? 
- Easily access, process and filter the UCDP datasets.
- Receive data in JSON format.
- Reduce the burden of data management and manual data versioning.
- Utilize built-in versioning to ensure consistency of data across time.

## Documentation
For more detailed information on using the API, please refer to the official [UCDP API documentation](https://ucdp.uu.se/apidocs/).
